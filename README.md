## Assignment Two - Server-side Implementation
The assignment focuses on the back-end implementation of a database which can connect to the front-end site.

>The assignment is due **27th April 2022**. 
## The Brief
The brief provides an additional file, the design requirements, which contains most of the information about the assignment.

The design requirements state that the following must apply to the assessment response:

### Function (Implementation)

 - [ ] Communicate to a backend database service using PHP and MySQL
 - [ ] Allow users to sign up to the shop in order to make purchases
 - [ ] Provide latest offers from the database presented on the homepage of the web application
 - [ ] Present the shop items from the database rather than statically hardcoded inside the HTML
 - [ ] Contain a README file detailing any set up instructions (passwords for tutors to assess the work) and any decisions you've made you want the tutor to know which is evidenced in the demonstration

### Optional Extras

 - [ ] Use sessions to detect when a user is logged in (in order to make purchases)
 - [ ] Provide extra functionality to search for products in the shop (for example, using PHP to obtain a list of products, or searching for using text and presenting this information by updating the front-end using JS).
 - [ ] Provide a personalised welcome message when a user is logged in
 - [ ] Provide user friendly feedback (when a user log in is incorrect, adding items to a basket has a problem etc)
 - [ ] Provide a user friendly 404 error page if a page is not available when accessed
 - [ ] Provide a means to register new users to the shop
 - [ ] Allow logged in users the functionality to leave reviews on products with average star rating and text messages
 - [ ] Store passwords security by hashing and salting using the bcrypt mechanism
 - [ ] Present dynamic information from the database responsively to meet the minimum requirements of the first assessment (responsive mobile design)
 - [ ] Use passing of POST/GET variables to access product items rather than using the sessionStorage object as preferred in assessment 1

 ## The Marking Scheme
 There is a banded marking scheme, the criteria below is used as a guide with academic judgement to determine a grade
 

 - Design and evaluate appropriate user interfaces for front-end web applications - Wireframing with annotations overlaid
 - Develop a front-end web application using modern development environments - web application implementation (detailed breakdown below)
 - Justify a choice of interaction methods and identify appropriate contexts of use for web applications - questions in demo regarding responsive web design
 - Demonstrate an awareness of current industry standards including those related to security, accessibility, and the design and development of web applications - questions in demo regarding HTML5 API (local/sessionStorage), web front-end frameworks etc...
